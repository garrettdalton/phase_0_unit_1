# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM is basically a standard interface for website models which include html and css.  To sum it up, it basically defines a webpage as a document which includes many different elements which are nested in eachother.  Also, It specifies that those nested elements are related either by a parent or child relationship, meaning that child elements inherit traits from the parent elements.


* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
	My site was much more basic, as well as having basically random color choices (somewhat intentional when I did it).  Also I realized that my site has a lot more styling options, and is currently missing any sort of interesting actions.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	I found it equally fun, helpful, and a pain.  It is definitely useful and fun to live edit a webpage.  Certain actions you can take for example being able to quickly change colors using a palette was great, but at the same time tricky to find sometimes.  I am still very, very confused by the hover options and locations of certain css elements.  I think once I get down the locations of css stuff (like hover) I will utilize it a lot more!

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	I reread the DOM resources after coming to this relflection and it helped a tremendous amount.  When I first read it I was kinda confused by the terminology being thrown around.  After using the chrome dev tools it was easier to understand.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
		I just used the given resources.
