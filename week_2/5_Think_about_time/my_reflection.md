# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
	My biggest challenge with time management is procrastination.  I love to put stuff off until the last minute, and often think that the crunch actually helps me work harder.

* How will you combat that? 
	What I need to do is get in the habit of doing work piecemeal:  start small, and things will end up big.  I have to develope the habbit of attempting to start things, and taking breaks in between.  I believe this will lead me to habitually start projects early, and therefore I won't have to crunch for hours at a time.

* What techniques will you try?
	I plan on trying the pomodoro technique.  I think If I get a timer and make myself do at least one 25 session on say monday (right when a new week in the unit comes out) I will actually end up doing several pomodoros worth of work.
	This will not only decrease me having to crunch but get some work out of the way earlier in the week.

	I would also like to try to meditate a bit.  After reading the article on meditation, I tried it for about 2 minutes. I definitely fely a little bit more relaxed about the current crunch I am working on (to catch up on week 2).

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
	My overall plan is to incorporate the pomodoro technique, as well as relaxation from meditation in order to develope a better work schedule.  While crunching may help me, I believe if I start with small bursts of work earlier in the week, it will lead to my crunching earlier in the week.
	This combined with a better focus and relaxed attitude from meditation (apparantly) will hopefully reduce my stress and train me to work more efficiently and procrastinate less.
