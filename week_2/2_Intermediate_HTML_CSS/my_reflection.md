# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	I think that web standards definitely make sense, as different browsers most likely have trouble dealing with differently outlined html code.  The only bad part I think is that it adds a lot of time as far as coding/planning goes.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	For the most part the standard structure makes perfect sense to me.  It is basically setting up the website with a semantically described outline.  The only confusion comes from learning how to code html without the html5 guidelines.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	I definitely like them as my previous code was full of <div>s which sort of made it sloppy to navigate when looking for specific sections.  I am interested in using it in further code.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	Reset.css basically formats an html document for use across multiple browsers.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	I used to use firfox, but about a year or two ago I switched to chrome on every device.  I haven't noticed a difference between sites except I remember that certain websites from my college wouldn't work in firefox.  I imagine it is both good and bad that they are different.  Bad in that different looks (or not working) is most likely not wanted for normal browsers.  But mobile browsers (on smaller screens like phones) would most likely want to be formatted differently.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I used www.yourhtmlsource.com a lot to remind myself about different html tags (as well as how to link within an article).
