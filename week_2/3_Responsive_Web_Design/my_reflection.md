# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
	Responsive web design is the idea of formatting your website to work with not only different browsers, but different screen sizes and different devices.

	I think it is definitely good practice, as nowadays people are more and more accessing web content from their phones and tablets.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	I think that the smaller screened devices have made web design much more adaptable in its approach.  Before widespread use of these devices, most websites were designed somewhat statically to be viewed on screen resolutions supported by computer monitors. 

	I'm not sure how new technology will affect web design.  Though with the coming of VR technology like oculus rift, I think web design could be adapted to allow viewing in a fully 3d environment.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
	My guess is that most visually impaired people need to magnify web pages in order to read them.  Those who are blind most likely  need specifically designed machines and software to read through content (unless the website has been designed with audio content in mind).

	Other than cost issues, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't offer use of your website for the visually impaired. Through browsing the internet, I have found that most blind persons use software to utilize their computer, so making the website work with popular software would most likely be the best way to open accesibility.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
	The concept of a website being fluid has definitely stuck with me. I recently have been working on a mac air with a small screen size, and websites which are not fluid can be frustrating as I generally resize them to about have the screen resolution.

	What doesn't make sense to me is that all the brosers are not necessarily on the same page with this.  I can't comprehend why they wouldn't all be made to work in a similar fashion.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I didn't find it on my own, but Danielle Sublett posted on google+ about responsivegridsystem.com which was extremely useful as far as demonstrating a structe that allows for fluidity as well as explaining the source code behind that structure.
