# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: garrettdalton.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
	I learned that making a website look good and be useful is not very easy.  I also learned that websites take a long long time to plan and execute properly.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	To be honest, I kind of hated it.  The reason I hate it however, is more because I needed to relearn how to plan a website.  I found that once I used some pseudocode, and started working on it piecemeal instead of all at once, I became much better at it.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	When I first started, I tried to just sit at my computer and think though the whole website.  I did the wireframe which was helpful, but then just tried to plan the html and css out in my head.  After becoming way too overloaded, I decided to take a break.  After the break, I made up some css pseudocode to see what elements I needed and how I wanted them designed. I then started coding the html piece by piece in tandem with the css affecting those pieces.  This sort of made me 'click', and learn how to design better.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	I wouls definitely like to clean up the color scheme, and figure out how to round edges.  I am also not sure if it is accesible on smaller screens.  Also I would like to redo the blog template format.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	Learning how to link within pages was great!  Applying the responsive web design learning was very difficult.  It was I'm not the most artistically/visually inclined so I am still confused about that material.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I used responsivegridsystem.com that I used in an earlier challenge.
