## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
this brings new files to git's attention and basically keeps track of the file

#### branch
Adds a new branch with supplied name.  Allows the user to create a seperate timeline of commits/changes from the master.

#### checkout
navigates to target repo/branch

#### clone
creates a local copy of target repo on your machine 

#### commit
saves the current state of the repo

#### fetch
fetch grabs updates from a tracked repository without updating your local repos

#### log
shows the log of your commits

#### merge
joins two branches together, the specified branch will be merged with the current one

#### pull
basically a fetch and then merge in one command.  Updates your local files based on updates fetched from the tracked repo

#### push
This updates changes from your local repo to your online repo

#### reset
Will point the HEAD to target location, as well as set the master to that location

#### rm
removes a file from the working tree and index

#### status
looks at the current state of your repo, shows files, changes staged to commit, and what branch you are in

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
2. Solution
3. Cause (explain the error)

## Release 6: Reflection
My strategy for this challenge was pretty straightforward.  I just went through the resources and tried to drill the important parts of git into my brain.  The main problem I face was that It doesn't say in the directions that you have to navigate to the right directory in order to use git commands. This took me a while to figure out, and I kept thinking it was because I set up a repo on github, when I was just in the wrong directory.

The given resources answered most of my questions, the one question I had was what git reset really did (as I had to explain it for the quiz).  I googled around and read several different definitions to come to my answer.

The whole process was learning new skills and tricks as I had relied heavily on using the github app to push my changes to the github website.

I would say overall that I am pretty confident with the competencies.

I love learning new commands and coding techniques, so for the most part I enjoyed this challenge.  The part I found tedious was the initial setup for git in the terminal window (which I had done weeks ago and didn't remember exactly) as I was attempting git commands in the wrong directory.
