      <p>To Garrett and myself, programming is essential because it reflects skills needed in the real world and because it's an excellent way to learn the material.
        Modern software is created by teams of people, not one person sitting in solitude. It's a social experience, thus it is vital to get practice in learning with others.
        In addition, programming in pairs allows for pairs to bounce questions and ideas off of each other. This exercise makes learning concepts easier as it provides an opportunity
        to gain a second perspective.

      <p>When it comes to programming in pairs, it is a generally accepted practice that one partner assume the role as the driver and the other as the navigator.

<!--U1.W2: GPS 1.1: Your First Pairing Session!-->
<!--DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CHALLENGE UNTIL YOUR FIRST GUIDED PAIRING SESSION!!-->

<!--Learning Competencies-->

<!--Use HTML tags to place content on a website-->
<!--Apply CSS to position elements on an HTML page-->
<!--Compare different HTML tags to one another-->
<!--Examine pair-programming concepts-->
<!--Summary-->

<!--Welcome to your first Guided Pairing Session (GPS!) We are excited to have you in Phase 0 and to work with you to get you prepared for an exciting time at DBC.-->

<!--This GPS is designed to help you examine pair programming and the roles of driver and navigator.-->

<!--Since this is your first pairing session, it is important to have a good check-in (so don't forget!).-->

<!--GPS-Specific Instructions-->
<!--After you finish this exercise, copy and paste your collaborative code into a local HTML and CSS document and push this new page up to your github.io website to publish it online - and link to it from the index of your site...Also add the code to the phase_0_unit_1 repo in the pre-made files.-->
<!--You will be directed to Stypi.com, where your instructor will have a stypi file ready for you. Because we cannot actually link a stylesheet to an HTML page in stypi, we will be placing CSS between the <style> tags. It will be your job to put the correct material in the correct file after the session. This is not good practice, we are only doing it so you can preview your page using stypi.-->
<!--Now you are ready to begin! Your goal is to design a website that introduces the concept of pair programming! (You get to figure out how to present it on the page)-->
<!--Release 0: Wireframe the site-->
<!--Discuss how you want the page to look. Draw a wireframe or use a wireframing tool with your pair. It doesn't have to be perfect, but get a rough idea of how you want the site to look-->

<!--Release 1: Start with HTML-->
<!--Include: a title and your names on your site. Style it based on your wireframe.-->

<!--Release 2: Discuss Pair Programming-->
<!--Together, discuss and describe why you think pair-programming is important to DBC. Code up what you've discussed according to the wireframe you made. Also discuss what pairing means and define driver and navigator. You will want to compare these on the website.-->

<!--Release 3: Dress it up!-->
<!--Use CSS to make it look nice. Include pictures, outside fonts, etc.-->

<!--Release 4: Reflect with your pair.-->
<!--What was it like to pair for the first time? Did you enjoy it? What worked? What didn't work? Add your reflection to your page and style it as well.-->

<!--Release 5: Copy, commit, and sync-->
<!--When you are finished, copy your code into the gps1.1.css and gps1.1.html files. Make sure your css from the <style> section is in the CSS file and remove it from the HTML section. Update the html file. Then, test that everything is still working by saving them and running them together from your computer.-->

<!--Commit and sync/push your changes onto the phase_0_unit_1 repository.-->
