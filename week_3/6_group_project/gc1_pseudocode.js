// My role in the group is: person 1

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//I want a tool called 'sum' which can do the following:
// Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in the list can vary) and give me the sum of those numbers

//I want a tool called 'mean' which can do the following:
// Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in the list can vary) and give me the average of those numbers

//I want a tool called 'median' which can do the following:
// Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in the list can vary) and give me the sum of those numbers




//What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
// I didn't really encounter many problems, as person 1, the only real issue was waiting for the other members to submit.
// It wasn't much of an issue though, as we seemed to communicate well and get our parts done in time.  It definitely was
// a highlight as to how much communication is needed in programming.

// What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
// I didn't have questions as I just had to generate user stories from test code.

// What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
// I figured out how important pseudocode is, and just how important it is for every step of the coding
// process needs to be accessible by multiple people.

// Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
// Haha, I learned how to reply all on emails, which is very useful!!

// How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
// I would say I am confident in them, though I worry a little about my pseudocode.

// Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
// I enjoyed watching the communication all come together.

// Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
// Working up the courage to be person 1!  I was sweating about whether or not my user stories were readable.

// What was this experience like?
// It was definitely unique, It was kinda scary relying on other people and having other people relying on you.
// I was so nervous being user 1, I worried that I would mess the whole thing up.

// Was your group successful in passing the tests?
// Our group completed each test successfully.

// What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?
// I learned that user stories need to be expertly written so that many different people can understand them.
// I learned the importance of things being clear, concise, and accessible at each and every step of developent.
// I had never really thought pseudocode was very important, and mine is often not very neat or acessible.  Now I
// realize how neccesary it is that it be communicable.
