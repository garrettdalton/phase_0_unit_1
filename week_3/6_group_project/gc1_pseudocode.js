// My role in the group is: person 1

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//I want a tool called 'sum' which can do two things:
// 1. Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in that list being odd) and give me the sum of the listed numbers
// 2. Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in that list being even) and give me the sum of the listed numbers

//I want a tool called 'mean' which can do two things:
// 1. Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in that list being odd) and give me the average of the listed numbers
// 2. Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in that list being even) and give me the average of the listed numbers

//I want a tool called 'median' which can do two things:
// 1. Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in that list being odd) and give me the median of the listed numbers
// 2. Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in that list being even) and give me the median of the listed numbers
