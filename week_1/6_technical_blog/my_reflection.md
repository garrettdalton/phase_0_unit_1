## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: garrettdalton/github.io

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

The learning parts of it was definitely useful,  I learned a ton of new tricks and techniques, and it definitely tightened up my website building (my test websites were awful).  It was a bit tedious having to figure out how to do specific things (such as resize images) but ended up being a useful exercise in learning.  I felt best when I had finished my blog template and got the css code linked to it.  I felt less certain during the few road blocks I hit trying to figure out specifics (image resizing, image hosting/making a url with github)
