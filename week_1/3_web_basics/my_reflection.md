Firstly I learned that the internet and the web are actually different entities.  The internet is basically a tremendous amount of networks between computers whereas the wep is an application on those networks to display imformation via text, pictures, videos, etc.  Second, I learned that websites are actually split into client side and server side operations, and require seperate languages for each.

The most important is to remember what the website's purpose is, and therefore have the website reflect that purpose in its focus and elements.  Other important things to remember: the website layout (sitemap!), which languages you should utilize, how you want to host the website, and whether or not you should hire or get others to work on it.  Obviously the aesthetics can be an important part for retaining and attracting users.

I felt tremendous relief.  At first it wasn't working, and I spent hours starting from scratch to try and figure out where I went wrong.  I finally posted to the google+ page, where I was told that sometimes it can take a few minutes for the page to show up.  It is simultaneously gratifying and infuriating to know I did it correctly the first time, but was too impatient before throwing it all out and starting over.  Lesson learned(patience is a virtue).

Realizing that DNS can take a bit (which I had read but I guess didn't apply) after spending hours fixing a non existant problem really solidified the concept that websites can take time to be renamed or changed through DNS.  The "aha" moment for me was probably when I read Ryan's post and realized I just didn't give it enough time.

I didn't find resources specifically,  but I did realize the massive resource that the google+ community (as well as communicating with my peers) is.  This was a real eye opener as to how important it is to communicate.
