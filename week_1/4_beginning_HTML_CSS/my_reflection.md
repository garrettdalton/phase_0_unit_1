Most of what I learned made perfect sense to me. html is rather straightforward as a language and is pretty easy to use.  It makes sense that it is formatted just like an outline since most text can be simplified into an outline.  What didn't make sense to me was the implication of em and strong versus bolding and italicizing something in css.

The good: html is rather straightforward and easy to use.  At first glance it seems to be very focused on content and very little else, which makes sense for building a framework for a webpage.
The bad: as far as coding goes, html is a real pain as far as having to enclose everything with tags.  Also, you are somewhat limited in what you can do (css fixes this it seems).  As a personal con, it is somewhat hard for me to visualize what the website will look like before I see it in a browser.

The only aha moment I had was when I realized just how css inheritence/cascading works.  It styles the page in a sort of top down approach and as far as my test went the higher rule would overwrite the lower rules.

I found the tutorial on html at codeacademy to be very useful, as it was a quick way to see what the html syntax looked like (my slideshow wasn't correctly showing the examples).
