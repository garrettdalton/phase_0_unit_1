Hey guys, my name is Garrett and Im tossing out this email for week 1 challenge 9.
I currently live in Tuckhoe in Westchester about 30 minutes north of Manhattan.  Some of my favorite websites include reddit.com, kotaku.com, and youtube.com.  My thinking style is abstract Random and my learning style is Multimodal according to those tests.

heres my unit 1 repo:  https://github.com/garrettdalton/phase_0_unit_1
heres my blog index: http://garrettdalton.github.io/
and my wireframe mockups: http://garrettdalton.github.io/unit1_projects/wireframe_sites.html
 Hope you guys are well and I hope all those work for you.  Feel free to send me an email if anyone wants to get a peer session going this week.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Haven't seen anyones reflections yet, but I defintely feel better since I was able to complete this first week in a timespan limited by finals and work.  I am definitely much more excited for on site now that I have begun learning so much.

[Update]
Reading my accountabillity buddies stuff has definitely eased my nerves a little bit.  It's easy to feel all alone when dealing with a large workload, especially when you hit those snags that you just can't get out of (thank you google+ for saving me).  Being able to read and see others thoughts and feelings on DBC has definitely cemented the idea that we are all in the same boat and that we are eachothers strongest resource in tackling this beast.  Hopefully I can drill that into my head instead of stubbornly trying to fix stuff (for 3 hours) that was solved within minutes by a fellow peer.  Here's to more snags and challenges and (hopefully) overcoming them!
