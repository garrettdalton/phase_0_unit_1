I learned how the way you design, and the thought process going in, matters a tremendous amount as far as beginning a project.  I also learned the user experience is probably the most important data you can gather during the build phase.  The wireframes were very fun to work with, it was fun trying to replicate the sites as much as possible, and I ended up being pretty good at mocking them up.

The question I asked was whether or not I would be capable of drawing a mock up page, as I am a miserable artist.  I used Mockflow to create drafts, which was extremely useful in creating the mockups.

None of the concepts were too troublesome on this challenge.  Obviously putting the design process into practice will take effort in the futre.

I am very confident with the competencies.

I enjoy getting used to the mockup tools.  I also enjoyed the speed and precision with which I was able to whip up a quick html page.

The only tedious part for me was figuring out how/where to save a folder of three images in order to host them in the repo.
