## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

In order to create a repository on GitHub, you must first login to your account.  After which you need to select add under the repositories tab.  In order to set up a repository, you must name, set it to public or private, choose whether or not to include a readme, and you can choose to add a license.  The name is important as it is what you will access this repository with either remotely or locally, meaning you can access it from the computer you created it on or through the internet.  The choice whether to set it to public or private enables you to allow github users to view your repository (public) or make your repository only viewable to you (private).  The readme is a small file allowing you to describe your code or include any comments you want to those people viewing it.  And adding a license gives you a choice as to how you want your code to be distributed and edited by the community you have given access to it, while retaining you as the owned of your material.

Open source is the concept that not only are you sharing with users the end program (which is any type of software a person uses) but also the source code which created said program.  Open source is used with the idea being that the coding community can and will make edits to the program in order to build upon or change the program for different uses.

Open source excites me for the most part, as I love the idea that as I get better at programming I will be able to tinker with other people's code to suit my own purposes and test out my abilities.  I am aware of open source code in video games which allow users to modify the game in order to create their own experience using the games elements.  The only scary part for me is pretty silly, as I am new to programming, but the idea that someone could use your code to possibly make monetary prophet without you knowing frightens me.  I think the idea behind open source is utopian, in that it encourages a community to pool talent in order to produce extremely useful programs.  I am aware that this does open up the code for users to exploit and break for malicious purposes though.
 +
 +Licenses to me seem important in protectly the rights of the creator of code.  While the open source licenses for the most part allow other users to use the source code for their own purposes, it still credits the original user for coming up with the program.  Not only does it protect the creator, but it also makes sure that the code remains in the public open source domain.
 +
 +The 'aha' moment for me was when I was trying to puzzle through the MIT open source license.  I was confused about a license which seems to only stipulate that the code must retain the MIT license, as I didn't see what purpose that served.  Then I realized that the purpose of the license was to ensure that deviations of the source code remain in the open source domain, and that While users could modify the code for monetary purposes, their program must also remain open source.
 +
 +I didn't seek any sources other than the ones provided, I think I have gotten the idea behind the licensing for open source during my 'aha' moment.  It not only protects the rights of the creator, but ensures that the code remain in the open source domain.
