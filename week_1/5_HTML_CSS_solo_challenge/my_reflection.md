I asked a tremendous amount of questions after I got about halfway through the challenge.  Unfortunately most of these were due to unclear directions.  I had a ton of trouble trying to figure out how to add height/width to the divs at first because the directions to do so are listed in the html section of the challenge.  What added further to this issue is the fact that padding borders and margins are also listed in the html section of the challenge.  I spent a ton of time trying to get the commands to work in html, when they ended up being a css issue.  Eventually I found my way onto the google+ community, where people had a similar issue and said they used css for those parts.

The positioning is an odd concept to me, maybe I am viewing the web page wrong but I found it very hard to get the header and footer to 'stick' to the top and bottom of the page.  Because of their absolute positioning, other elements ignore them completely, which created really awkward attempts at relative positioning for me.  In my head it would make more sense to anchor them in a way that other elements auto position below or above them.  Perhaps I will figure it out later on.

Using div is probably the best new trick of this exercise.  Being able to combine different tags in a single element which can then be acted on by css seems incredibly useful.  The pseudo selectors trick for links is very cool as well.

The HTML tags I am very confortable with.  I feel that I understand the positioning for the most part, I just seem to have an issue as far as elements position around/next to eachother.  I had to use sloppy relative positions and guess/check in order to complete the challenge.

I really enjoyed discovering the full usefulness of div, as well as seeing the results of the pseudo selector on links.

This challenge was extremely tedious for me.  I had a lot of trouble positioning elements, and my solution still seems sloppy to me.  It might be the way that I am viewing the end result of the code.  Unfortunately, a large amount of frustrationg stemmed from the unclear directions, and attempting things in html which I am now pretty sure are meant to be done in css.
